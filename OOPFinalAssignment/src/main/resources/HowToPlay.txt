Checkers Game Instructions
Objective:
The objective of Checkers (also known as Draughts) is to capture all of your opponent’spieces or block them
so they cannot make any legal moves.

Game Setup
Board: A standard Checkers board is an 8x8 grid with alternating dark and light squares.
The game is played only on the dark squares.
Pieces: Each player starts with 12 pieces. 
One player has dark pieces (usually black), and the other has light pieces
(usually red or white).
Initial Position: Place the pieces on the three rows closest to each player.
The pieces should only be on the dark squares. Each player should have 12 pieces on the board atthe start.

Basic Rules
Turns: Players alternate turns, with the darker pieces moving first.
Movement:
Regular Pieces: Pieces move diagonally forward, one square at a time, to an empty square.
Capturing: If an opponent's piece is adjacent to a player's piece and the square beyond it is empty, the
player's piece can jump over the opponent's piece, landing on the empty square.
The opponent's piece is then removed from the board. Multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn if the position allows it.

Crowning (Kinging):
When a piece reaches the farthest row from its starting position(the opponent’s back row), it is "kinged."
A king is typically marked by stacking an additional piece on top of the first.
Kings can move diagonally forward and backward, unlike regular pieces, which can only move forward.
Winning the Game
The game is won when one player captures all the opponent’s pieces or blocks them from making any move.

Draws
The game can end in a draw if neither player can force a win or both players agree that the game is a stalemate
